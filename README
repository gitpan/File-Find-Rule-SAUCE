NAME
    File::Find::Rule::SAUCE - Rule to match on title, author, etc from a
    file's SAUCE record

SYNOPSIS
        use File::Find::Rule::SAUCE;

        # get all files where 'Brian' is the author
        my @files = find( sauce => { author => qr/Brian/ }, in => '/ansi' );

        # get all files without a SAUCE rec
        @files    = find( sauce => { has_sauce => 0 }, in => '/ansi' );

DESCRIPTION
    This module will search through a file's SAUCE metadata (using
    File::SAUCE) and match on the specified fields.

METHODS
  sauce( %options )
        my @files = find( sauce => { title => qr/My Ansi/ }, in => '/ansi' );

    If more than one field is specified, it will only return the file if ALL
    of the criteria are met. You can specify a regex (qr//) or just a
    string.

    Matching on the comments field will search each line of comments for the
    requested string.

    has_sauce is a special field which should be matched against true or
    false values (no regexes). has_sauce => 1 is implied if not specified.

    See File::SAUCE for a list of all the fields that can be matched.
